Despite this great\nvariety of models to choose from, they can all be distilled into three\ncomponents.</p>\n<p>The three components that make a machine learning model are representation,\nevaluation, and optimization. These three are most directly related to\nsupervised learning, but it can be related to unsupervised learning as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Representation</strong> - this describes how you want to look at your data.\nSometimes you may want to think of your data in terms of individuals (like in\nk-nearest neighbors) or like in a graph (like in Bayesian networks).</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation</strong> - for supervised learning purposes, youâ€™ll need to evaluate or\nput a score on how well your learner is doing so it can improve. This\nevaluation is done using an evaulation function (also known as an <em>objective\nfunction</em> or <em>scoring function</em>). Examples include accuracy and squared error.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimization</strong> - using the evaluation function from above, you need to find\nthe learner with the best score from this evaluation function using a choice of\noptimization technique. Examples are a greedy search and gradient descent.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning</a></li>\n</ul>",
