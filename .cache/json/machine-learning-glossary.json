See individual pages for\nmore details.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> - Intersection of statistics and computer science in\norder to teach computers to perform tasks without explicitly being programmed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deep Learning</strong> - An umbrella terms of machine learning methods based on learning data representations as opposed to algorithms based on fulfilling a given task. It include architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Statistical Learning</strong> - the use of machine learning with the goal of\nstatistical inference, whereby you make conclusions of the data rather than\nfocus on prediction accuracy</li>\n<li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong> - Using historical data to predict the future. Example: Using historical data of prices at which houses were sold to predict the price in which your house will be sold. Regression and Classification come under supervised learning.</li>\n<li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong> - Finding patterns in unlabelled data. Example: Grouping customers by purchasing behaviour. Clustering comes under unsupervised learning.</li>\n<li><strong>Regression</strong> - A machine learning technique used to predict continous values. Linear Regression is one of the most popular regression algorithm.  </li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Classification</strong> - A machine learning technique used to predict discrete values. Logistic Regression is one of the most popular classification algorithm.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>f: x -> y  </code></pre>\n      </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here ‘f’ is a function that takes ‘x’ as input and produces ‘y’ as output.</p>\n<p>If the output value ‘y’ is a real number / continous value then the function\nis a regression technique.  </p>\n<p>If the output value ‘y’ is a discrete / categorical value then the function is a classification technique.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>- **Clustering** - Grouping of unlabelled data.
