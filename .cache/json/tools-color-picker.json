You can use it to choose between how various colors and tones go together and find the differences between them. Color pickers often show colors and their information in various formats, including Hexadecimal and RGB.</p>\n<h3>Online Websites</h3>\n<p>Color picker websites offer the simplest way to quickly choose between colors and get information about them. They are helpful for when you are unsure about using a color tone or another or just want to get the color you are using in a different format.</p>\n<h3>Browser Extensions</h3>\n<p>Installing a color picker browser extension allows you to get information about the colors used on web pages. It is useful when you see a color somewhere and want to get the code for it. Just click or hover the place where the color is and the extension will show you the code so you can use it somewhere else.</p>\n<h3>Code Editor Packages/Extensions</h3>\n<p>Another practical way to have a color picker is to install it as a package or extension on your favorite editor. It gives you the possibility to visualize and change colors by simply clicking on them, without having to leave your editor. In addition to commonly used CSS styles, they also often support SASS and LESS variables and colors in various formats.</p>\n<h3>More Information:</h3>\n<p>You can check common examples of color picker tools below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href='https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>W3schools online color picker</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href='http://www.colorzilla.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>ColorZilla browser extension</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href='https://atom.io/packages/color-picker' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Color picker package for Atom</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href='http://www.instant-eyedropper.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Instant Eyedropper</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
