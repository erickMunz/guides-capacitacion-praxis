In this example, <code>E</code> refers to the experience of playing chess, <code>T</code> is the task of playing chess, and <code>P</code> denotes the probability that the program will win the next game of chess.</p>\n<p>In general, machine learning problems can be classified into supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, you have the input and the labeled output, and you suspect that a relationship exists between the input and the labeled output. When you know neither what the labeled output is nor if a relationship exists, unsupervised learning will help you find structure in your data if there is one.</p>\n<p>In sum, there are two broad categories of machine learning</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Supervised learning</li>\n<li>Unsupervised learning</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are however other subcategories of machine learning you may encounter such as Semi-supervised and reinforced learning.</p>\n<h3>Supervised learning</h3>\n<p>Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from supervised training data. The training\ndata consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object\n(typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). Further, the supervised learning can be taken as 2 paradigm, classification and regression.</p>\n<h4>Basic flowchart/steps for supervised learning</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Collect training set.</li>\n<li>Divide training set into input object (features) and output object (classes or value)</li>\n<li>Decide what you will be applying, regression or classifier</li>\n<li>Decide which algorithm will you be applying, SVM, deep net, etc</li>\n<li>Run the algorithm on training set and use the model for predictions</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Courses:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href='https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120?autoenroll=true' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Intro to Machine Learning</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning - Taught by:  Andrew Ng</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.udemy.com/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Data Science and Machine Learning with Python - Hands On!</a></li>\n<li><a href='http://ciml.info/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Video Resources:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A\" target=\"_blank\">Siraj Raval’s Youtube channel</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ\" target=\"_blank\">Sentdex’s Youtube channel</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning on Wikipedia</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uAOzhzs-U' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning Demystified:Youtube</a></li>\n<li>If you want a brief introduction of machine learning, and you prefer videos, try this <a href='https://youtu.be/cKxRvEZd3Mw' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>machine learning introduction video</a></li>\n<li>If you want to know how to proceed with learning machine learning, take a look at this <a href='https://youtu.be/nKW8Ndu7Mjw' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'> video</a></li>\n</ol>",
