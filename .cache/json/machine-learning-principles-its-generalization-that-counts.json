This is\nthe essential goal of machine learning: to generalize a learner’s findings.</p>\n<p>To test a learner’s generalizability, you’ll want to have a separate test data\nset that is not used in any way in training the learner. This can be created by\neither splitting your entire training data set into a training and test set, or\nto just collect more data. If the learner were to use data found in the test\ndata set, this would create a sort of bias in your learner to do better than in\nreality.</p>\n<p>One method to get a sense on how your learner will do on a test data set is to\nperform what is called <strong>cross-validation</strong>. This randomly splits up your\ntraining data into a given number of subsets (for example, ten subsets) and\nleaves one subset out while the learner trains on the rest. And then once the\nlearner has been trained, the left out data set is used for testing. This\ntraining, leaving one subset out, and testing is repeated as you rotate through\nthe subsets.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/153058/132399' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>“How do you use test data set after Cross-validation”</a></li>\n</ul>",
