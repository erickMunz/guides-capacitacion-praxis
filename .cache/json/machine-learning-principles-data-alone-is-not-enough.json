Collecting\nmore time series data might not be the best to help your learner. This is\nbecause a binary classifier isn’t designed for time series.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that once you’ve chosen the best machine learning algorithm\nbased on your problem that adding more data does you no good. In this case, it\nwill help you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Machine learning is not magic; it can’t get something from nothing. What it\ndoes is get more from less…Learners combine knowledge with data to grow\nprograms (Domingos, 2012).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning</a></li>\n<li><a href='http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/06/machine-learning-more-data-better-algorithms.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>In Machine Learning, What is Better: More Data or better Algorithms?</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.quora.com/In-machine-learning-is-more-data-always-better-than-better-algorithms/answer/Xavier-Amatriain?srid=Tds3' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>In machine learning, is more data always better than better algorithms?</a></li>\n</ul>",
