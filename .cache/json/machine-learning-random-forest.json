This means that the tree becomes so used to the training data that it has difficulty making decisions for data it has never seen before.</p>\n<h3>Solution with Random Forests</h3>\n<p>Random Forests belong in the category of <strong>ensemble learning</strong> algorithms. This class of algorithms use many estimators to yield better results. This makes Random Forests usually <strong>more accurate</strong> than plain decision trees. In Random Forests, a bunch of decision trees are created. Each tree is <strong>trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of the features of that data</strong>. This way the possibility of the estimators getting used to the data (overfitting) is greatly reduced, because <strong>each of them work on the different data and features</strong> than the others. This method of creating a bunch of estimators and training them on random subsets of data is a technique in <em>ensemble learning</em> called <strong>bagging</strong> or <em>Bootstrap AGGregatING</em>. To get the prediction, the each of the decision trees vote on the correct prediction (classification) or they get the mean of their results (regression).</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href='https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Random_forest' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Random Forests (Wikipedia)</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/06/introduction-random-forest-simplified/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Introduction to Random Forests - Simplified</a></li>\n<li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loNcrMjYh64' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>How Random Forest algorithm works (Video)</a></li>\n</ul>",
