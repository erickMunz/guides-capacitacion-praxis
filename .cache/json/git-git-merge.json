To handle those changes, you can either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new branch and commit the changes</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-shell\"><code>git checkout -b new-branch-name\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"<your commit message>\"</code></pre>\n      </div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stash them</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-shell\"><code>git stash               # add them to the stash\ngit merge new-features  # do your merge\ngit stash pop           # get the changes back into your working tree</code></pre>\n      </div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Abandon it all</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-shell\"><code>git reset --hard        # removes all pending changes</code></pre>\n      </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about the <code>git merge</code> command and all available options, please refer to the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Git documentation</a>.</p>",
