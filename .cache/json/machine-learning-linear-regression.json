When the variables Y are plotted, linear regression finds the best-fitting straight line through the points. The best-fitting line is called a regression line.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.mladdict.com/linear-regression-simulator' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Online linear regression simulator</a></p>\n<p>In Python:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-py\"><code>#Price of wheat/kg and the average price of bread\nwheat_and_bread = [[0.5,5],[0.6,5.5],[0.8,6],[1.1,6.8],[1.4,7]]\n\ndef step_gradient(b_current, m_current, points, learningRate):\n    b_gradient = 0\n    m_gradient = 0\n    N = float(len(points))\n    for i in range(0, len(points)):\n        x = points[i][0]\n        y = points[i][1]\n        b_gradient += -(2/N) * (y - ((m_current * x) + b_current))\n        m_gradient += -(2/N) * x * (y - ((m_current * x) + b_current))\n    new_b = b_current - (learningRate * b_gradient)\n    new_m = m_current - (learningRate * m_gradient)\n    return [new_b, new_m]\n\ndef gradient_descent_runner(points, starting_b, starting_m, learning_rate, num_iterations):\n    b = starting_b\n    m = starting_m\n    for i in range(num_iterations):\n        b, m = step_gradient(b, m, points, learning_rate)\n    return [b, m]\n\ngradient_descent_runner(wheat_and_bread, 1, 1, 0.01, 100)</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Code example is from <a href='http://blog.floydhub.com/coding-the-history-of-deep-learning/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>this article</a>.

The normal equation can also be used for finding the linear regression coefficients, however, this uses matrix multiplication, and therefore can be very time consuming to use for more than 100,000 or 1,000,000 instances.</p>",
