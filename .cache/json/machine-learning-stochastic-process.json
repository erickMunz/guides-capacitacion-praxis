Note that it may have a probability distribution and may not be completely random. For instance the process where a 2-sided <em>unfair</em> coin is flipped again and again. Or for instance, direction a drop of water may take on a roughly plain surface (non-determinism here may arise due to occassional roughness which makes it hard to determine the path of the droplet).</p>\n<h3>More Information:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process\">Stochastic Process</a></li>\n</ul>",
